# OM
OM is a micro PHP router for web development.

Sometimes you want to built really small PHP websites and/or webservices (API) using friendly URLs such as "myscompany.com/services" or "mycompany.com/contact" without using frameworks like Laravel because you actually don't need a bunch of features or functionalities.

So here are some files to help you to do this small work.

Your website will be inside the "dist" folder. To use:

1 - Download this files;

2 - Create your own routes files on "dist\app\routes\" folder;

3 - Edit "dist\app\start.php" file;

4 - Add your own code on "dist\app\" folder;

5 - Publish what you have inside the "dist" folder.

For more information, get in touch.

# Gulp
To help you to build assets for your OM website, use the gulp folder (if you don't wanna use it, just delete these folder):

1 - Install the node modules (node.js is required):

```
npm install

```

2 - List the gulp tasks:

```
gulp

```
