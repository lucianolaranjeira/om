# Om
Om is a micro PHP router for web development.

Sometimes you want to built really small PHP websites and/or webservices (API) using friendly URLs such as "myscompany.com/services" or "mycompany.com/contact" without using frameworks like Laravel because you actually don't need a bunch of features or functionalities.

So here are some files to help you to do this small work.

To use:

1 - Download this files;

2 - Create your own routes files on "..\app\routes\" folder;

3 - Edit "..\app\start.php" file;

4 - Add your own code on "..\app\" folder;

5 - Run it. Try on localhost first.
