Om is a micro PHP router for web development.

Sometimes you want to built really small PHP websites and/or webservices (API) using friendly URLs such as "myscompany.com/services" or "mycompany.com/contact" without using frameworks like Laravel because you actually don't need a bunch of features or functionalities.

So here are some files to help you to do this small work.

To use:

1 - Download this files;

2 - Create your own routes on "..\app\routes\";

3 - Edit "..\app\start.php";

4 - Add your own code on "..\app\";

5 - Run it.

Try on localhost first.

For more information, get in touch.
